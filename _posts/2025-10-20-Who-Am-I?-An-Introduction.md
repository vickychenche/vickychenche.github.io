## Who Am I? An Introduction.

### Greetings, fellow readers,

Welcome to my blog! I’m committing to posting at least once every two weeks, ideally once a week. This space will be where I document my experiences and learning moments. I’m also a huge fan of books, so on weeks where I don’t have time to dive deep into becoming a Rustacean, I’ll share thoughts on books, quotes, life updates, and maybe even some neat dad jokes.

### Ok, getting into the meat of things.

I recently graduated from the University of Toronto, where I specialized in Computer Science and minored in Biology. Currently, I’m working as a Data Engineer at Hubio, focusing on building scalable systems and automating data workflows. My journey into tech began with a love for problem-solving and creating impactful solutions.

As I continue to grow both personally and professionally, I realized that keeping myself accountable and reflecting on my progress is key. Blogging feels like the perfect way to do that — by documenting what I learn, sharing my experiences, and staying engaged with my goals. I want this blog to be a reminder to keep pushing forward, even on days when it feels tough.

#### A climbing anecdote — you might be hearing about this a lot in the future.

I recently got back into climbing and training consistently to become stronger. I started a project on a Moonboard (we can dive into that another time). When I first started, I couldn’t even do a single move. After two months of consistently trying every move in isolation, working on endurance and power, I finally sent it. This was my first successful climb on the Moonboard.

Anyways, like climbing, failure only makes me want to try even harder. Yes, it can be defeating at times, but that doesn’t mean I won’t come back to it the next day—or the day after. There’s something about constantly showing up and chipping away at a problem that just drives me.
